# Kitchen Sync

**Peer-to-Peer QSR Order Sync with Zero Configuration**

A demo Android app showcasing [Couchbase Lite's MultipeerReplicator](https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/android/p2psync-multipeer.html) for automatic device discovery and real-time data sync -- no server, no URLs, no manual setup. Devices on the same WiFi network find each other automatically and sync orders in real time.

Built to demonstrate how Couchbase Lite's P2P auto-discovery eliminates the need for server infrastructure in Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) operations.

## What This Demonstrates

- **Automatic Device Discovery** -- Devices find each other via DNS-SD (Android NSD) with zero configuration
- **Real-Time P2P Sync** -- Orders sync instantly across all connected devices using MultipeerReplicator
- **Mesh Network** -- Every device syncs with every other device, no single point of failure
- **TLS Security** -- All peer communication is encrypted with self-signed certificates
- **Offline-First** -- Each device has its own local Couchbase Lite database; sync happens when peers are available
- **No Internet Required** -- Works entirely over local WiFi (airplane mode + WiFi ON)

## Why MultipeerReplicator? (New API vs Old Approach)

This app uses Couchbase Lite 4.0's **MultipeerReplicator** API, which replaces the older **URLEndpointListener + Replicator** pattern for P2P sync. The difference in developer effort is significant.

### Old Approach: URLEndpointListener + Replicator

With the previous WebSocket-based P2P API, developers had to build and manage every layer of the P2P stack manually:

```
Developer is responsible for:

1. Service Discovery    Write Android NSD (NsdManager) code to register and browse
                        for services on the local network
2. IP + Port Tracking   Resolve discovered services to get IP addresses and ports,
                        maintain a list of known peers
3. URL Construction     Build WebSocket URLs: wss://<ip>:<port>/<database>
4. Listener Setup       Configure and start a URLEndpointListener on one device
                        (the "server") to accept incoming connections
5. Replicator Setup     On every other device (the "clients"), create a Replicator
                        pointed at the listener's URL
6. Topology Design      Choose and implement a topology -- star, ring, mesh --
                        and manually manage which device connects to which
7. TLS Certificate      Generate certs, distribute them to peers, configure trust
    Exchange            validation on both listener and replicator sides
8. Reconnect Logic      Handle disconnections with exponential backoff, detect
                        dead peers, re-resolve addresses on IP changes
9. Connection Tracking  Track active connections, avoid duplicates, clean up
                        stale connections when devices leave
```

**Result:** ~100+ lines of P2P plumbing code, a rigid **star topology** (one listener, many clients), and a **single point of failure** -- if the listener device goes down, all sync stops.

### New Approach: MultipeerReplicator (What This App Uses)

With MultipeerReplicator, the entire P2P stack collapses into a single API call:

```java
// The ENTIRE P2P setup -- discovery, mesh, TLS, reconnect -- all handled automatically
MultipeerReplicatorConfiguration config = new MultipeerReplicatorConfiguration.Builder()
    .setPeerGroupID("com.kitchensync")       // Shared group name (like a WiFi SSID)
    .setIdentity(identity)                    // TLS cert (self-signed is fine)
    .setAuthenticator(authenticator)          // Trust validation callback
    .setCollections(collections)              // Which data to sync
    .build();

MultipeerReplicator replicator = new MultipeerReplicator(config);
replicator.start();  // Done. Devices auto-discover and form a mesh.
```

**Result:** ~30 lines of code, a **self-organizing mesh** topology, and **zero single points of failure**.

### What Gets Eliminated

| Responsibility | Old (URLEndpointListener) | New (MultipeerReplicator) |
|---|---|---|
| **Device Discovery** | Write NSD browse/register code manually | Automatic via DNS-SD (Android NSD) |
| **IP/Port Management** | Resolve, track, and update peer addresses | Handled internally |
| **URL Construction** | Build `wss://ip:port/db` per peer | No URLs -- peer group ID only |
| **Topology** | Star only (1 listener, N clients) | Self-organizing mesh (all peers equal) |
| **Single Point of Failure** | Yes -- listener dies, sync stops | No -- mesh reroutes automatically |
| **TLS Setup** | Manual cert exchange between listener and clients | Mutual TLS built-in (just provide an identity) |
| **Reconnection** | Code exponential backoff and dead-peer detection | Auto-healing with rerouting |
| **Connection Tracking** | Maintain peer list, avoid duplicates, clean up stale | Managed by the replicator |
| **Lines of P2P Code** | ~100+ | ~30 |

### Key Architectural Difference

```
OLD: Star Topology (fragile)              NEW: Mesh Topology (resilient)

     +--------+                           +--------+
     | Kiosk  |                           | Kiosk  |------+
     +---+----+                           +---+----+      |
         |                                    |           |
         v                                    v           v
    +---------+                          +---------+  +---------+
    |Listener |<----+                    | Kitchen |--| Manager |
    |(Kitchen)|     |                    +---------+  +---------+
    +---------+     |
         ^          |                    Every device syncs with every
         |          |                    other device. If one drops,
    +---------+     |                    the rest continue syncing.
    | Manager |-----+
    +---------+

    If the listener dies,
    ALL sync stops.
```

The MultipeerReplicator handles discovery, topology, security, and fault tolerance internally -- letting developers focus on the application logic instead of distributed systems plumbing.

| **Peers** | Live P2P mesh visualization showing all connected devices and their roles |

All views are accessible from any device via the 5-tab bottom navigation (Kiosk / Status / Kitchen / Manager / Peers), regardless of which role was selected at launch.

### QSR Order Flow

```
Customer at Kiosk          Kitchen Make Line         Order Status Board        Store Manager
     |                          |                          |                        |
     |  1. Place Order          |                          |                        |
     |------------------------->|  2. Order appears         |                        |
     |                          |     automatically         |                        |
     |                          |------------------------->|  "Preparing"            |
     |                          |  3. Mark Ready            |                        |
     |                          |------------------------->|  "Ready for Pickup"     |
     |  4. Pick up order        |                          |                        |
     |                          |  5. Mark Picked Up        |                        |
     |                          |                          |----------------------->|  Revenue updated
```

**Same-customer orders are automatically appended** -- if the customer name matches an existing open order, new items are added to it instead of creating a duplicate.

## Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or newer
- **JDK 17** (required for Gradle 8.12)
- **Android Emulator v36.5.10+** (supports shared virtual WiFi for P2P between emulators)
- **Android SDK 34** with `google_apis` system image for `arm64-v8a`

---

## Quick Start (Step by Step)

### 1. Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhijeetkb06/KitchenSync.git
cd KitchenSync
```

Verify JDK 17 is configured. Check `gradle.properties` and update the path if needed:
```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.0.5.jdk/Contents/Home
```

Build the APK:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### 2. Update Android Emulator

P2P discovery between emulators requires **Android Emulator v36.5.10+** with shared virtual WiFi support.

1. Open **Android Studio > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Android SDK > SDK Tools**
2. Check **Android Emulator** and ensure it's **v36.5.10** or later
3. Click **Apply** to update if needed

### 3. Install System Image

Ensure the Android 14 system image with Google APIs is installed:

```bash
sdkmanager "system-images;android-34;google_apis;arm64-v8a"
```

Or install via Android Studio SDK Manager under **SDK Platforms > Android 14 > Google APIs ARM 64 v8a System Image**.

### 4. Create 3 AVDs (Android Virtual Devices)

Create three emulators representing different QSR devices:

```bash
# Using cmdline-tools (adjust path to your SDK)
AVDMANAGER=$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/avdmanager

# Kiosk Phone (Pixel 5)
$AVDMANAGER create avd -n "KitchenSync_Kiosk" \
  -k "system-images;android-34;google_apis;arm64-v8a" \
  -d "pixel_5" --force <<< "no"

# Kitchen Tablet (Pixel C)
$AVDMANAGER create avd -n "KitchenSync_Kitchen_Tablet" \
  -k "system-images;android-34;google_apis;arm64-v8a" \
  -d "pixel_c" --force <<< "no"

# Manager Phone (Pixel 5)
$AVDMANAGER create avd -n "KitchenSync_Manager" \
  -k "system-images;android-34;google_apis;arm64-v8a" \
  -d "pixel_5" --force <<< "no"
```

Or create them via **Android Studio > Device Manager > Create Device**.

### 5. Launch All 3 Emulators

```bash
emulator -avd KitchenSync_Kiosk -no-snapshot-load -no-audio &
sleep 5
emulator -avd KitchenSync_Kitchen_Tablet -no-snapshot-load -no-audio &
sleep 5
emulator -avd KitchenSync_Manager -no-snapshot-load -no-audio &
```

Wait for all 3 to boot. Verify they're online:
```bash
adb devices
# Should show:
# emulator-5554  device
# emulator-5556  device
# emulator-5558  device
```

### 6. Install the App on All 3 Emulators

```bash
adb -s emulator-5554 install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb -s emulator-5556 install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb -s emulator-5558 install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### 7. Launch the App

```bash
for emu in emulator-5554 emulator-5556 emulator-5558; do
  adb -s $emu shell am start -n com.kitchensync/.ui.roleselection.RoleSelectionActivity
done
```

### 8. Select Roles and Grant Permissions

On each emulator:
1. Select a role (Kiosk / Kitchen / Store Manager)
2. Tap **"While using the app"** when prompted for location permission
3. The devices will auto-discover each other -- you'll see "N peers connected" in the toolbar

### 9. Test the Flow

1. **Kiosk**: Browse the menu (Tacos, Burritos, Sides, Drinks), add items to cart, enter a customer name, tap "Place Order"
2. **Kitchen**: Watch the order appear in real-time with food images -- tap "Start Preparing" > "Mark Ready" > "Picked Up"
3. **Place another order for the same customer name** -- items are appended to the existing open order
4. **Status Board tab**: See orders split into "Preparing" and "Ready for Pickup" columns
5. **Store Manager tab**: View dashboard with live order counts, today's revenue, and network status
6. **Peers tab**: See the live P2P mesh network with all connected devices

---

## Proving It Works Without Internet (Airplane Mode Demo)

To prove the app uses only local WiFi and not the internet:

### Option A: From the Emulator UI
1. On each emulator, **swipe down twice** from the top to open Quick Settings
2. Tap the **Airplane mode** tile to turn it ON
3. Tap the **Internet/WiFi** tile and turn WiFi back ON
4. The notification will say **"Wi-Fi on in airplane mode"**
5. WiFi shows connected to **"AndroidWifi"** -- but airplane mode blocks all internet
6. Place orders and watch them sync in real-time -- all over local WiFi

### Option B: Via ADB Commands
```bash
# Enable airplane mode + re-enable WiFi on all emulators
for emu in emulator-5554 emulator-5556 emulator-5558; do
  adb -s $emu shell cmd connectivity airplane-mode enable
  sleep 1
  adb -s $emu shell svc wifi enable
done

# Verify: all should show Airplane=1, WiFi connected to AndroidWifi
for emu in emulator-5554 emulator-5556 emulator-5558; do
  echo "=== $emu ==="
  adb -s $emu shell settings get global airplane_mode_on
  adb -s $emu shell cmd wifi status | grep -E "Wifi is |connected"
done

# Restore internet after demo
for emu in emulator-5554 emulator-5556 emulator-5558; do
  adb -s $emu shell cmd connectivity airplane-mode disable
done
```

### Key Talking Points
- **No server URL anywhere in the code** -- no `ws://`, no cloud endpoint, no Sync Gateway
- **MultipeerReplicator** only takes: a local database, a TLS identity, and a peer group name
- **DNS-SD (Android NSD)** discovers peers via multicast on the local WiFi subnet
- **TLS mutual authentication** secures all peer connections
- Orders sync in real-time even with airplane mode ON -- only local WiFi is needed

### Key P2P Components

**CouchbaseManager** is the core singleton that manages:
- Couchbase Lite database initialization
- TLS identity creation (self-signed cert with CLIENT_AUTH + SERVER_AUTH, unique per app launch)
- MultipeerReplicator configuration and lifecycle
- Event listeners for peer discovery, replication status, and document sync

```java
// The MultipeerReplicator setup -- this is all it takes
MultipeerReplicatorConfiguration config = new MultipeerReplicatorConfiguration.Builder()
    .setPeerGroupID("com.kitchensync")
    .setIdentity(identity)
    .setAuthenticator(new MultipeerCertificateAuthenticator((peer, certs) -> true))
    .setCollections(collections)
    .build();

MultipeerReplicator replicator = new MultipeerReplicator(config);
replicator.start();  // That's it -- devices auto-discover and sync
```
